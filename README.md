# OTT-Movies-Recommendation-Mini-Project
Group mini project – OTT Movie &amp; Web-Series Recommendation System (Jan–Aug 2025 dataset).

This group mini project focuses on building an OTT Movie & Web-Series Recommendation System using Python. The dataset was manually collected by the team from Jan–Aug 2025, processed in Google Colab, and cleaned using Pandas and NumPy. RapidFuzz fuzzy matching is implemented so the system can recognize movie/series titles even with spelling variations and recommend the OTT platforms where they are available to stream.
